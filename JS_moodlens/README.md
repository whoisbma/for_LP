I collaborated with Stiliyan Lazarov on this code for Radical Media.
It used PhantomJS to run canvas code, which I wrote to emulate a shader that was running on the front end. You should be able to run it but it will be slow. 

(Translating GLSL to canvas is probably the strangest thing I've had to write.)
